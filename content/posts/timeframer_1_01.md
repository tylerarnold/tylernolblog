I have had 1.01 of Timeframer in the app store for over a week, 1.02 should be getting pushed up there within a few days. The major feature to 1.01 is the alpha blending feature, that enables the user to compose photos that line up more easily with prior photos in the time sequence. I intend to make some more improvements to this feature in a future release, but am adding other features and fixes before that. The App is still free, I will be adding an in-app purchase option soon that will remove the advertisements, and restrict certain features to the premium version only.
