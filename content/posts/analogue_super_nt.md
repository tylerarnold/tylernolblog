 I missed the release of Analogue's original Nintendo emulator, but the Super Nintendo version
 is a more reasonable price point. Rather than a software emulator of the original hardware, this is a hardware emulator/reproduction
 of the original SNES hardware in an Altera Cyclone FPGA. So theoretically, this hardware is completely identical to the original, which should make a difference for 100% faithful game timing and sounds, with additional provisions for supporting modern screens. This hardware can also be jailbreaked easily to run ROMs off an SD card.
