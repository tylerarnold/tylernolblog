      <description>Kudos to Google for making progress on their own chip designs, but it is strange to ship a product with a disabled piece of hardware this significant. I suspect it will not be enabled for some time and perhaps never enabled due to some untested bug they found as they try to integrate it after it has shipped.

      <description>I missed the release of Analogue&amp;rsquo;s original Nintendo emulator, but the Super Nintendo version is a more reasonable price point. Rather than a software emulator of the original hardware, this is a hardware emulator/reproduction of the original SNES hardware in an Altera Cyclone FPGA. So theoretically, this hardware is completely identical to the original, which should make a difference for 100% faithful game timing and sounds, with additional provisions for supporting modern screens.</description>
